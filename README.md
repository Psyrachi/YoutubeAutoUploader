A youtube video uploader

This is my first "big" project - I know it isn't very nice looking but I am really only just starting to code in general and I am working to get better :D

IMPORTANT
THIS IS MEANT FOR GOOGLE CHROME - IT MAY NOT WORK ON OTHER BROWSERS.
When using this script you must have two folders on your desktop which sit at the top of your desktop folder with the video and thumbnail (Thumbnail above Video folder).
There must be no downloads at the bottom of the chrome window.
The script makes the video title and description CHANGE_ME so you know to change it. At the very end of the program it brings you back to the naming section of the youtube studio uploader.
